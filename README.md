# YulixCFW

## What is this?
This is a custom firmware for the Nintendo 3DS.

## But there is already Luma3DS.
Yes, however, yulix is also an opportunity for me to learn more about hardware. Yulix is not made for permanent use. It is intended for people who want to learn more about bare metal development and customize their console as they want.

## Does it add more features ?
For the moment it is just a project made to create the bare minimum to mod a 3DS

## Who can contribute to the project ?
Absolutely everyone, any help is welcome

## Can I use it right now ?
Nop Yulix can't boot for the moment, but it will !

I'm really happy to be able to propose this project, it's a good opportunity for me to learn even more about hardware. If you are interested in the project or even in 3DS modding come and join me on my discord: https://discord.gg/NFPVppqcRs. Thanks you.
